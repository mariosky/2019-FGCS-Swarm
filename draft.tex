\begin{abstract} 
Multi-population based methods have been used extensively in
recent years to improve the performance of nature-inspired optimization
algorithms, these methods are parallel and asynchronous by nature; researchers
take advantage of this to scale algorithms with distributed, multi-threaded,
parallel and cloud-based implementations. However, the design of distributed
versions of multi-population algorithms for their execution in cloud
infrastructures is not a trivial task. Designers need to adapt the algorithms to
leverage the benefits of scalability, elasticity, fault-tolerance,
reproducibility, and cost-effectiveness of reactive cloud-based systems. In this
work, we present the design and implementation of a reactive container-based
application for the execution of multi-population algorithms. Researchers can
use the application to execute multiple experiments, both locally or in a cloud
environment and deploy experiments by specifying the infrastructure as part of
an experiment definition so that it is much easier to reproduce results. We
evaluated the performance of the platform and the benefits of a multi-population
approach by using an ensemble of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) in a benchmark for the optimization of continuous functions.
Experiments show that the framework allows the ensemble to outperform
single-algorithm versions. The framework we provide also has fewer parameters to
tune since subpopulation parameters are selected randomly. The architecture and
the implemented platform is an excellent alternative for locally or a
cloud-based deployment.

\section{Introduction}

In the last decades, nature-inspired optimization algorithms have been succesfully
applied to solve complex real-world problems \cite{yang2014nature}. Algorithms
inspired in natural processes include evolutionary algorithms (EAs)
\cite{back1996evolutionary} and swarm intelligence (SI) \cite{kennedy2006swarm},
among others. These population-based algorithms share the common characteristic
of using an initial set of random candidate solutions that are later used to
generate a new set of candidates, using a nature-inspired heuristic. Popular EAs
are Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Genetic Programming (GP), grey wolf optimization
(GWO) and Differential Evolution (DE), while examples of (SI) are particle swarm
optimization (PSO) and ant colony algorithms (ACO).

Population-based algorithms are intrinsically parallel and
asynchronous. The fitness of each individual can be evaluated independently of
others, and similarly, each population could evolve in isolation. Since 
earlier works, researchers have been proposing some form of parallelization
\cite{muhlenbein1988evolution} to increase the scalability of these algorithms.
The island model was one of the first techniques proposed for parallelization,
which lead to an increased performance \cite{gorges1990explicit,grosso1985computer}. 
The concept was to divide a large population into communicated subpopulations. 
Since then, other population-based algorithms have adopted the concept, 
and researchers have found additional benefits
besides the execution speed; these include avoiding a premature convergence and
maintaining the diversity of the global population. Researchers use the term
multi-population based methods when generally referring to techniques using
subpopulations as part of their optimization strategy.

When designing efficient multi-population algorithms, researchers need to
consider additional issues. These include the number and size of subpopulations,
the interaction between them, the search area of subpopulations, and the search
strategy and parametrization of each subpopulation. We must take into account
these high-level issues when designing a parallel architecture. 

The parallel execution of multi-population algorithms has been the focus of many
works,  going from earlier hardware-based implementations using transputers,
multi-threaded, and multi-core systems. Recently the trend has been on
exploiting a higher number of processing units by using GPUs, or distributed
systems: client-server, web-based, map-reduce,  grid, and cloud computing. Cloud
computing is becoming the standard way of running enterprise applications, not
only because of the convenience of the pay-as-you-go model or the non-existent
cost of administration, but it also offers a way of describing the
infrastructure as part of the code, so that it is much easier to reproduce
results and this has been a boon for scientific computing.  However,  cloud computing
has also been evolving, going from monolithic applications, that is,
applications built on a single stack of services that communicate by layers, to
microservice and serverless architectures that favor the parallel and
asynchronous communication of heterogeneous resources. In these architectures,
services or even functions are seen as single processing points, that departing
from the monolithic and even distributed paradigms, become a loose collection of 
{\em stateless functions}, that react to events and they only exist while they 
are doing some processing. 


Based on a reactive architecture \cite{guervos2018introducing} , each subpopulation is represented as an event message that is pushed asynchronously into a message queue. Incoming messages trigger stateless functions that receive the subpopulation and proceed to run an algorithm, using the parameters and population included in the message. After the specified number of iterations, each stateless function returns the evolved subpopulation by again pushing a message to another queue, used for receiving the resulting subpopulations. Subpopulations are received from the queue by a controller that is responsible for mixing the individuals from different subpopulations and producing new subpopulations. These new subpopulations are pushed again by the controller into the message queue, creating a loop. The cycle stops when the controller receives a subpopulation containing a candidate solution that satisfies a particular condition, or a maximum number of messages were received. 

Taking these factors into account, in this work, we present Swarm, a  multi-container Docker application that reactively processes isolated and heterogeneous subpopulations. The platform uses the Docker Compose tool for defining and running experiments as multi-container applications. Docker Container images host the stateless functions responsible for running algorithms on subpopulations. Researchers then define the configuration of services used by a multi-population algorithm using a YAML file. Other researchers can deploy and start all the services from this configuration file with a single command. Once the services are up, multiple instances of an experiment can be sent to a queue for their execution.  The platform includes containerized services that are compatible with other container orchestration technologies like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm. The services included are a Redis Server used for the Message Queue implementation and logging and an Experiment Controller implemented in python.  Developers of sub-population processing functions have the freedom to implement new population-based algorithms or operators in the language they choose inside a container, as they only need to subscribe to a channel of the Message Queue and have the ability to read the population and parameters as JSON file.  

This paper extends our earlier publication on the topic \cite{guervos2018introducing}, and we highlight the main contributions as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item First, we present the design and implementation of a reactive container-based application for the asynchronous execution of multi-population algorithms. The source code and example container definitions are publicly available.
	\item Second, we propose a method for the deployment and execution of multiple experiments by specifying the infrastructure as part of an experiment definition in both local or cloud environments,  facilitating the reproduction of experimental results.
	\item Third, the application is compatible with the COCO benchmark framework, allowing researchers to compare the performance of their algorithms with other works.
	\item Lastly, we present an empirical study to validate the applicability of our application,  measuring the execution time, speedup, and a comparison between homogeneous and an ensemble of multi-populations, using Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in a benchmark for the optimization of continuous functions.
\end{itemize}


\section{Multi-population design}

Multi-population based methods divide the original population into
smaller subpopulations or islands, with every subpopulation carrying out the
algorithm independently, with synchronous or asynchronous communication with the
rest of the islands. This relative isolation helps in maintaining an overall
diversity since each subpopulation will search in a particular area, at least
between communications. The recombination mentioned above (mixing) or migration
between subpopulations is needed to avoid a premature convergence of candidate
solutions since smaller populations are known to perform better for a given
problem than bigger populations. However, it gives them the added advantage of
parallel operation. Additionally, and in some cases, multi-population algorithms
scale better than expected due to the interaction between the algorithm and the
parallelism of the operation \cite{ALBA20027}.

However, in most cases, algorithms applied to each subpopulation are
homogeneous, or at any rate, the same variant of the algorithm. As long as this
parallel operation is not synchronous, other population-based algorithms, or, as
a matter of fact, any algorithm, could be easily integrated. That is why several
works based on multi-population are heterogeneous, integrating various
optimization algorithms, and often performing better than single-population or
homogeneous optimization algorithms \cite{wu2016differential,nseef2016adaptive}.

Heterogeneous algorithms add another degree of freedom to the problem of finding
the correct parameter settings for an algorithm; because some parameters affect
the accuracy of the solution and the convergence speed of the algorithms as they
tip the balance between exploration and exploitation of the search space. On the
other hand, current studies show that by having a high number of subpopulations
interacting in parallel, the effect of the individual parameters of each
subpopulation is compensated by those selected in other subpopulations. In this
work, we will use random settings within a specific range as results have shown
this is a valid solution to this problem. 

Some parameters, specially the population size, are
kept fixed in order to control more easily the execution of the algorithm. For
instance, by having the size of subpopulations fixed, it is easier to control
the number of evaluations and the communication costs, when the algorithm is in
operation.

Combining multiple algorithms, with different parameters, interacting with each
other at the same time, can benefit from the strengths of each. For instance, a
genetic algorithm could find a promising global solution that is not optimal
while another algorithm, more suitable for a local search, finds the global
optimum. This approach has been followed extensively in recent years, with
success. Moreover, there is a need for frameworks, architecture, and
implementation models that can allow researchers the development of new
parallel, asynchronous, heterogeneous, and parameter-free algorithms in a scalable way.
